## How it works

It use's -->
'''
    --> os module,
    --> requests module,
    --> platfrom module,
    --> upnpclient module.

***Local_IP is collected from the cmd(in Windows) or Bash-Terminal(in Linux) using 'ipconfig'/ 
'hostname -I' command.So there is no need to get the hostname like socket module does and 
the accuracy of the output is 100% in Linux Os.

***Global_IP is collected by sending request to 'https://checkip.amazonaws.com' or 
'https://www.wikipedia.org' using python requests module.So to get the global_ip a stable 
net connection is needed.

***External_IP  of any router or alike devices can be collected using upnpclient module.
It takes a little more time to get the external_ipaddress Compare to other two functions.Though it don't require
stable Internet connection but requires a stable connection between the devices.
